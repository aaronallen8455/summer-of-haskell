# Faq

Our policies are largely similar to that of Google Summer of Code, please refer
to their FAQ page found [here](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq).

Some notable exceptions to Google's policies are:

 -  Contributors to Summer of Haskell can apply for up to two projects
 -  Summer of Haskell follows a slightly different timeline (see [homepage](./))
