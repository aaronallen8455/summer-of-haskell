# Faq

Our policies are largely similar to that of Google Summer of Code, please refer
to their FAQ page found [here](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq).

Some notable exceptions to Googles policy are:

 -  Contributors can apply for more than one project
 -  We are following a slightly different timeline (see [homepage](./))
