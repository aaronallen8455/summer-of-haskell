### What is the goal of Summer of Haskell?
This program is designed to bring new contributors into open-source communities
and encourage further open-source contributions after the end of the program.
New open-source contributors will spend their summer writing code under the
guidance of mentors from the Haskell community.

---

### When and where does Summer of Haskell happen?
The timeline:

 -  April 3 - 20 projects submissions
 -  May 4 announcement of accepted proposals, projects briefing
 -  May 29 coding starts
 -  July 14 midterm evaluation due
 -  July 14 - Aug 21 further coding
 -  Aug 21 - 28 evaluation
 -  Sept 5 announcement of results (and, eventually, extending the deadline)
 -  Nov 6 final deadline
 -  Nov 13 final evaluation

The program is run entirely online.

---

### Is Summer of Haskell considered an internship, a job, or any form of employment?
No. Summer of Haskell is an activity that a participant performs as an
independent developer for which they are paid a [stipend](/stipend.html).

---

### Are mentoring organizations required to use the code produced by participants?
No. While we hope that all the code that comes out of this program will find a
happy home, we don't require organizations to use the contributor's code.

---

### Can I participate in Summer of Haskell as a mentor and a contributor at the same time?
No. If you apply to be a contributor, it means you are new to open-source, and
mentors need to be experienced in contributing to OSS.

---

### What are the eligibility requirements for participation?

 -  You must be at least 18 years of age when you register, and you must be
    eligible to work in the country you will reside in during the program.
 -  You must be an open-source beginner or a student.
 -  You must reside in a country that is not currently embargoed by the United
    States. What's more, due to current circumstances, Summer of Haskell 2023
    is not accepting participants (Contributors, Mentors, or Organization
    Administrators) from Russia, Belarus, or the so-called Donetsk People's
    Republic ("DNR") and Luhansk People's Republic ("LNR"). There are no
    restrictions on participants located within Ukraine but outside of the DNR
    and LNR. For further information, please contact us via email.

---

### Can I apply for more than one project?
Yes, you can apply for up to two projects - however, we will pick only one from
your proposals.

---

### How much time does Summer of Haskell participation take?
Medium-size projects should take about 175 hours to complete, while large
projects should take about 350 hours to complete. Depending on your skills and
the difficulty of your project, it may take you more or less time to meet the
goals of your project. If it becomes clear that your project was underscoped or
overscoped, you and your mentor will work together to adjust accordingly.

---

### I am a student in the United States on an F1 visa. How do I get authorization to participate?
Please talk to your school's international student affairs office for more
details before applying to Summer of Haskell. It is best to do it as soon as
you think you may want to participate in Summer of Haskell. Also, please
confirm that you can accept your stipend (due to visa regulations, it might be
an issue).

---

### Who can be a mentor in the Summer of Haskell?
You must already be a community member who is running an active free/open
source software project under an Open Source Initiative approved license.

---

### What if I have more questions?
Please write us an email at `summer [AT] haskell.org`.
