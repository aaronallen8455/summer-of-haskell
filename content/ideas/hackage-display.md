title: Hackage features (new ranking, user info update, email notifications)
---

There are a number of features for Hackage that would make good gsoc projects. Among them:

* implementation of PackageRank as a possible
sorting metric (<https://github.com/haskell/hackage-server/issues/986>).
* a user info account update feature to let users change their own email address: https://github.com/haskell/hackage-server/issues/167
* relatedly, finishing user notification emails and allowing them to be managed from that page: https://github.com/haskell/hackage-server/pull/622

A variety of other related tickets are under the ux tag on the hackage github
repo: <https://github.com/haskell/hackage-server/labels/component%3A%20ux>

**Potential Mentors**: Gershom Bazerman

**Difficulty**: Medium

**Size**: 175 hours or 350 hours (depending on how many features the proposal covers)
