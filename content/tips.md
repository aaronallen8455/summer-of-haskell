# Tips for writing a good proposal

Some general tips on writing a proposal are discussed
[in Google's official guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).

 -  **The most important thing** that we look for in proposals is that you
    understand the project.  You can show this by describing how you would
    approach the implementation.  Quality is more important than quantity,
    this doesn't need to be longer than a page.

 -  What interests you in the project?

 -  Please include a tentative plan or schedule with some milestones.

 -  Feel free to provide a brief CV, but please keep it limited to the
    experience that is relevant for GSoC.  If you have contributed to Haskell
    projects in the past, please include this!

If you don't fully understand the project yet -- **no problem**!  We welcome
new people, and mentors are happy to answer questions or give you feedback on
proposal drafts.  [Let us know](/contact.html) if you want us to put you in
touch with the relevant mentors.
